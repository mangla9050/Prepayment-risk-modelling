# Prepayment Risk Modelling on Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)

## Overview
This project aims to model the prepayment risk associated with Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS). By analyzing historical loan data and various financial indicators, we seek to predict the likelihood of loan prepayment and understand the factors influencing this risk.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
    - Encode categorical variables appropriately.
    - Label the data for accurate model training.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- PowerBI
- Tableau
- Excel
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Technocolabs100/Prepayment-risk-modellling-on-MBS.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Prepayment-risk-modellling-on-MBS
    ```
3. Install required Python libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### Dataset
Download and extract the dataset:
- [LoanExport.zip](https://github.com/Technocolabs100/Prepayment-risk-modellling-on-MBS/blob/main/LoanExport.zip)
- Place the extracted files in the `data/` directory.

### Variables Definition
Review the variables definition to understand the dataset:

## Tasks

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Perform the following tasks:
1. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Handle missing values.
    - Remove duplicates.
    - Correct data types.
  
2. **Data Encoding**:
    - Encode categorical variables using techniques like One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.

3. **Data Labelling**:
    - Ensure the dataset is properly labelled for analysis.

### 2. Data Visualization 
- Use PowerBI, Tableau, or Excel to create visualizations that help in understanding the data better.
